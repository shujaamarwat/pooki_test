# PookiTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.4.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` to start both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Starting the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the Application (Frontend and Backend):**

   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both the Angular frontend and Node.js backend servers simultaneously. 

   - Angular frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`
   - Backend server (`server.js`) will run alongside the frontend.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
